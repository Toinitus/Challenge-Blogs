			<h2>I'm kidding</h2>
			<p>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.</p>

			<h2>I work</h2>
			<p>Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.</p>

			<h2>Now which way to the welfare office?</h2>
			<p>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!

			<h2>Save me</h2>
			<p>You don't win friends with salad. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.

			<h2>Don't kid yourself</h2>
			<p>Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"</p>

			<h2>If a cow ever got the chance</h2>
			<p>Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</p>

			<h2>Every time I learn something new</h2>
			<p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies?

			<h2>Remember when I took that home winemaking course</h2>
			<p>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.

			<h2>Look out, Itchy! He's Irish!</h2>
			<p>I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.</p>

			<h2>I'll keep it short and sweet</h2>
			<p>I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</p>

			<h2>Family. Religion. Friendship.</h2>
			<p>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life.

			<h2>These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</h2>
			<p>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.
