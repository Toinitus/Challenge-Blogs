			<h2>Look out, Itchy! He's Irish!</h2>
			<p>I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! Marge, you being a cop makes you the man!

			<h2>I'll keep it short and sweet</h2>
			<p>I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. A woman is a lot like a refrigerator. Six feet tall, 300 pounds…it makes ice.</p>

			<h2>These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.</h2>
			<p>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.
